# Introductory notebooks for parallel in time algorithms

## Authors:
* Jemma Shipton, University of Exeter
* Juliane Rosemeier, University of Exeter

These notebooks were produced for a [workshop on exascale computing challenges](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/exascale-computing-challenges-parallel-in-time-algorithms-registration-463477492657?aff=oddtdtcreator) funded by the [ExCALIBUR programme](https://excalibur.ac.uk/) as part of the [Research Software Engineer training project](https://excalibur.ac.uk/projects/rse-training-algorithms/).

Each algorithm is introduced in a notebook, along with theory,
skeleton code and suggested exercises. The completed notebooks are
also included in this repository.
